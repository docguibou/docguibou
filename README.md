- 👋 Hi, I’m Guillaume Boutin aka @gboutin-lops (even though I don't work in LOPS anymore)
- 👀 I’m interested in geophysical model development and analysis, whether they represent the ocean, sea ice or waves!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning that academia is tough, but still enjoyable sometimes. Also getting better at python from time to time.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on wave--sea ice stuff?
- 📫 How to reach me: See there --> https://www.nersc.no/staff/guillaume-boutin
